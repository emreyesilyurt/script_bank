Constructed from High-Impact, UV Resistant Polycarbonate material that provides superior durability to impacts and ease of modification while maintaining minimum weight. It is well suited for high temperature or corrosive environments. The lid includes two vents with installed rain guards and filters.

Once the brackets are installed the enclosure can be mounted directly to any flat wall surface provided proper screws are used into secure studs. The brackets, once installed, also allow you to use our HGX-PMT pole mount kits. The lid features a non-metallic hinge system that allows for quick removal & can be reattached just as quickly without the need for any tools. The enclosure comes with a pair of stainless-steel latches with padlock eyes allowing you to secure the enclosure from tampering. The enclosure comes in black. The HGX-PMT series of pole mounting kits allow the populated enclosure to be securely mounted to a variety of different size poles.

LCCA30251-FT1,LCCA30251FT1,"L-com's LCCA30251-FT1 is a low loss BNC male to N male cable assembly using LMR-200-FR coax, 1 FT with Times Microwave components and ships same-day. The LMR-200-FR coax of this BNC cable uses the PE dielectric with a VoP of 83%, resulting in very low insertion loss compared to solid dielectrics. These flexible RF cable assemblies are ideal for applications where flexure is required. Our L-com BNC to N cable assembly has a male to male gender configuration with flexible LMR-200-FR series coax and operates to 5.8 GHz. The double shield of this BNC cable is layered by tinned copper braid over aluminum tape providing shielding effectiveness greater than 90dB. *LMR™ is a trademark of Times Microwave Systems. Custom versions of this BNC male to BNC male cable, along with the rest of L-com's other RF assemblies, can also be built and shipped same day. Other available RF cable assembly value added services from L-com include connector orientation or clocking, heat shrink booting and custom labeling. RF testing can also be performed to document the electrical performance of your cable assembly. Contact a sales representative for testing or custom RF cable quotes.

HK2417-120,HK2417120,"The HyperLink Sectorized Omni Array features our high performance 2.4 GHz 120° sectorial antennas. Each of the three antennas in this array can be adjusted individually (0-20° up or down tilt) to compensate for the geography of the installation location. This helps ensure maximum coverage of the array for service providers in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.  Ideal for higher system capacities, each antenna fed individually in this array. The advantages of this type of system include higher gain than the single fed systems and better isolation of each of the three antennas. Interference from adjoining antennas is reduced thus improving performance.  The sectorized omni array is designed for all-weather operation. It features heavy-duty plastic antenna radomes and stainless steel mounting systems. The array can be mounted directly onto masts 1¼"" to 2"" (31.7 to 50.8 mm) in dia using the provided U-Bolts. The mounting bracket can also accept 3"" (76.2 mm) U-Bolts (not included) for larger masts.

LCCA30341-FT6,LCCA30341FT6,"L-com's LCCA30341-FT6 is a low loss 4.3-10 male to N female bulkhead cable assembly using LMR-600 coax, 6 FT with Times Microwave components and ships same-day. The LMR-600 coax of this 4.3-10 cable uses the PE (F) dielectric with a VoP of 87%, resulting in very low insertion loss compared to solid dielectrics. These flexible RF cable assemblies are ideal for applications where flexure is required. Our L-com 4.3-10 to N cable assembly has a male to female gender configuration with flexible LMR-600 series coax and operates to 5.8 GHz. The double shield of this 4.3-10 cable is layered by tinned copper braid over aluminum tape providing shielding effectiveness greater than 90dB. L-com's RF cable assembly with N bulkhead interface enables system designers to have external connections on their product enclosures or to be used for other rack mount and panel mount applications. *LMR™ is a trademark of Times Microwave Systems. Custom versions of this 4.3-10 male to 4.3-10 female cable, along with the rest of L-com's other RF assemblies, can also be built and shipped same day. Other available RF cable assembly value added services from L-com include connector orientation or clocking, heat shrink booting and custom labeling. RF testing can also be performed to document the electrical performance of your cable assembly. Contact a sales representative for testing or custom RF cable quotes.
