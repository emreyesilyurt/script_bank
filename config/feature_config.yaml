# Feature engineering configuration for part scoring

# Features to apply log1p transformation (handles zero values gracefully)
log_transforms:
  - inventory      # log1p(inventory) - compresses inventory range
  - first_price    # log1p(first_price) - compresses price range  
  - moq           # log1p(moq) - normalizes order quantities

# Features where lower values are better (apply inverse transform)
inverse_transforms:
  - leadtime_weeks  # 1/(1+leadtime) - shorter leadtime = higher score
  - first_price     # 1/(1+price) - lower price = higher score
  - moq            # 1/(1+moq) - lower MOQ = higher score

# Binary indicator features
binary_features:
  - is_authorized      # source_type == 'Authorized'
  - has_datasheet      # datasheet is not null
  - in_stock          # inventory > 0
  - immediate_availability  # leadtime_weeks == 0

# Composite features combining multiple signals
composite_features:
  - availability_score  # Combined availability metric
  - demand_score       # Normalized demand metric
